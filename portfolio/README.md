This page contains a selection of my open source contributions on various platforms: 

#### [Stimulus P](https://bert.bruynooghe-polet.com/stimulusP/index.html)

A coding kata featuring a documentation page exploring a simpler javascript implementation of Basecamp's [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev) concept.

#### [Gentse deelautos rekenmodule](https://github.com/GentseDeelautos/rekenmodule) (WIP)

A cost calculator for hiring cars from one of the car sharing providers active in Gent. Pure HTML + Javascript page, with CI tests verifying the tariffs used in the app. Graphs are currently disabled, but will be back online soon.

#### [VuexORM Sugar](https://gitlab.com/BertBruynooghe/vuex-orm-sugar)

Syntactic sugar on top of [VuexORM](https://github.com/vuex-orm/vuex-orm) as proof of concept of a more fluid way to interact with the framework (based on Rails' ActiveRecord syntax, and takes advantage of ES6.)  

#### [Low carb assistent](https://github.com/bertBruynooghe/lo_carb_assistent)

A (mobile) server-based Rails app to facilitate cross-device carb calculation for meals. Central database, and explorations on a simple, working interface on mobile.
Conceived as n=1 project and deployed on Heroku, and used almost daily.

#### [FreeStyle Libre gem](https://github.com/bertBruynooghe/freestyle_libre)

A Ruby gem for reading out values from USB from the FreeStyle Libre glucose sensor.

#### [Medtronic pump settings](https://jsfiddle.net/bertBruynooghe/8karfy5L/)

Pure HTML/JavaScript code to calculate a set of insuline pump settings based on a given one, a given ratio and custom roundings as implemented in the pump itself.
(Also an experiment in one line functions.)
