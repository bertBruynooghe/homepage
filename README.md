# StimulusP
My take on a programming paradigm based on [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/handbook/introduction), using browser only (no build technologies required).

Unlike some parts of Stimulus, it should feel like a javascript thing rather than a helper for Rails.

More explanation to be found [here](//bert.bruynooghe-polet.com/stimulusP) in a page that has been build with the same technologies.
