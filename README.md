# stimulus-minimal
pure javascript implementation of stimulus-like coding approach

## Stimulus: is it worth the 45kB?

Don’t get me wrong: I do like the idea of Stimulus, but I’m not sure if it’s worth the 45kB. And the syntax for actions: ‘data-action="change->start-message#close’: seriously?

Also, the class inheritance API seems so 2018… What if we keep the good 'convention over configuration’ of Rails (Stimulus’ stepdad) and try to come up with a minimal implementation the feels more natural to HTML/JavaScript developers?
