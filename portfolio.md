### Projects maintained by me

#### [Low carb assistent](https://github.com/bertBruynooghe/lo_carb_assistent)

A (mobile) web app to facilitate cross-device carb calculation for meals. Central database, and explorations on simple, working interface on mobile.
Deployed as n=1 project on heroku, and used daily.

#### [Gentse deelautos rekenmodule](https://github.com/GentseDeelautos/rekenmodule) (WIP)

A cost calculator for hiring cars from one of the car sharing providers active in Gent. Pure HTML + Javascript page, with CI tests verifying the tariffs used in the app. Graphs are currently disabled, but will be back online soon.

#### [VuexORM Sugar](https://gitlab.com/BertBruynooghe/vuex-orm-sugar)

Syntactic sugar on top of [VuexORM](https://github.com/vuex-orm/vuex-orm) as POC of a more fluid way (syntactic sugar) to interact with the framework (based on Rails' ActiveRecord syntax, and take advantage of ES6.)
